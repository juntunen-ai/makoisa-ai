# Google Ads Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document describes the Google AdSense integration implemented in the AI Recipe Generator application. The implementation follows best practices for non-intrusive advertising that is relevant to cooking and food content.

## Features

### ‚úÖ Non-Intrusive Design
- **Two ad placements only**: Sidebar and main content area
- **Cooking/food relevant ads**: Targeted to kitchen equipment, ingredients, and cooking tools
- **No pop-ups**: All ads are static and integrated into the page layout
- **Responsive design**: Ads adapt to different screen sizes

### ‚úÖ User Experience First
- **Clearly labeled**: All ads are marked as "Mainos" (Advertisement in Finnish)
- **Tasteful styling**: Ads blend well with the application design
- **Performance optimized**: Minimal impact on page load speed
- **Easy to disable**: Can be turned off via environment variables

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Add these variables to `recipe_ai/.env`:

```bash
# Google AdSense Configuration
GOOGLE_ADSENSE_ENABLED=true
GOOGLE_ADSENSE_CLIENT_ID=ca-pub-YOUR_PUBLISHER_ID
GOOGLE_ADSENSE_SIDEBAR_SLOT=1234567890
GOOGLE_ADSENSE_MAIN_SLOT=0987654321
```

### Ad Slot Setup

1. **Sidebar Ad**:
   - Format: Rectangle (250px height)
   - Location: Bottom of sidebar, after settings
   - Recommended for: Kitchen equipment, cooking books

2. **Main Content Ad**:
   - Format: Horizontal banner (90px height)
   - Location: Between header and main tabs
   - Recommended for: Food delivery, ingredient suppliers

## Implementation Details

### Ad Placement Strategy

The ads are placed in two strategic locations:

1. **Sidebar**: After user settings but before the "About" section
2. **Main Content**: Between the app description and the main tab navigation

### CSS Styling

```css
.ad-container {
    background-color: #f5f5f5;
    border: 1px solid #ddd;
    border-radius: 8px;
    padding: 15px;
    margin: 20px 0;
    text-align: center;
    font-size: 0.9em;
    color: #666;
}
```

### Content Guidelines

All ads should be relevant to:
- üç≥ **Cooking equipment**: Pots, pans, kitchen tools
- ü•ò **Food ingredients**: Spices, fresh produce, pantry items
- üìö **Cooking education**: Recipe books, cooking courses
- üè™ **Food services**: Grocery delivery, meal kits
- üçΩÔ∏è **Dining**: Restaurants, food experiences

## Content Policy Compliance

The implementation ensures compliance with Google AdSense policies:
